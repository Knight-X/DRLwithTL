# Deep Reinforcement Learning with Transfer Learning - Simulated Drone and Environment (DRLwithTL-Sim)

## What is DRLwithTL-Sim?
This repository uses Transfer Learning (TL) based approach to reduce on-board computation required to train a deep neural network for autonomous navigation via Deep Reinforcement Learning for a target algorithmic performance. A library of 3D realistic meta-environments is manually designed using Unreal Gaming Engine and the network is trained end-to- end. These trained meta-weights are then used as initializers to the network in a **simulated** test environment and fine-tuned for the last few fully connected layers. Variation in drone dynamics and environmental characteristics is carried out to show robustness of the approach.
The repository containing the code for **real** environment on a **real** DJI Tello drone can be found @ [DRLwithTL-Real](https://github.com/aqeelanwar/DRLwithTL_real)

## Installing DRLwithTL-Sim
The current version of DRLwithTL-Sim supports Windows and requires python3. It’s advisable to [make a new virtual environment](https://towardsdatascience.com/setting-up-python-platform-for-machine-learning-projects-cfd85682c54b) for this project and install the dependencies. Following steps can be taken to download get started with DRLwithTL-Sim

### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/aqeelanwar/DRLwithTL.git
```

### Download imagenet weights for AlexNet
The DQN uses Imagenet learned weights for AlexNet to initialize the layers. Following link can be used to download the imagenet.npy file.

[Download imagenet.npy](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ei4mCzjfLY5ql6ILIUHaCtAR2XF6BtAM)

Once downloaded, place it in
```
models/imagenet.npy
```

### Install required packages
The provided requirements.txt file can be used to install all the required packages. Use the following command
```
cd DRLwithTL
pip install –r requirements.txt
```
This will install the required packages in the activated python environment.


### Install Epic Unreal Engine
You can follow the guidelines in the link below to install Unreal Engine on your platform

[Instructions on installing Unreal engine](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/Installation/index.html)

### Install AirSim
AirSim is an open-source plugin for Unreal Engine developed by Microsoft for agents (drones and cars) with physically and visually realistic simulations. In order to interface between Python3 and the simulated environment, AirSim needs to be installed. It can be downloaded from the link below

## Running DRLwithTL-Sim
Once you have the required packages and software downloaded and running, you can take the following steps to run the code

### Create/Download a simulated environment
You can either manually create your environment using Unreal Engine, or can download one of the sample environments from the link below and run it.

[Download Environments](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u5teth6l4JW2IXAkZAg1CbDGR6zE-v6Z)

Following environments are available for download from the link above

* Indoor Long Environment
* Indoor Twist Environment
* Indoor VanLeer Environment
* Indoor Techno Environment
* Indoor Pyramid Environment
* Indoor FrogEyes Environment
* Indoor GT Environment
* Indoor Complex Environment


The link above will help you download the packaged version of the environment for 64-bit windows. Save the folder in the unreal_env folder.

### Edit the configuration file (Optional)
The RL parameters for the DRL simulation can be set using the provided config file and are self-explanatory. The details on the parameters in the config file can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-for-drones-in-3d-realistic-environments-36821b6ee077)

```
cd DRLwithTL\configs
notepad config.cfg (#for windows)
```

### Run the Python code
The DRL code can be started using the following command

```
cd DRLwithTL
python main.py
```

While the simulation is running, RL parameters such as epsilon, learning rate, average Q values and loss can be viewed on the tensorboard. The path depends on the env_type, env_name and train_type set in the config file and is given by 'models/trained/&lt;env_type>/&lt;env_name>/Imagenet/''. An example can be seen below

```
cd models\trained\Indoor\indoor_long\Imagenet\
tensorboard --logdir e2e

```
